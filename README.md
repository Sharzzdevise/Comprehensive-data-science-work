Comprehensive Analysis of Drug Reviews: Predicting Effectiveness, Sentiment, and Understanding Decision Factors. 
In the dynamic landscape of healthcare, the widespread use of online platforms has facilitated the dissemination of user-generated content, notably drug reviews. Despite their potential to offer valuable insights into patient experiences and treatment outcomes, extracting meaningful information from the sheer volume of unstructured data presents considerable challenges. Consequently, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies encounter the formidable task of deciphering user sentiments, predicting drug effectiveness, and performing an in-depth analysis of this data to uncover valuable insights based on these reviews.
